# EVA Assignment-5
The performed tasks are as follows:
1.Change the code 8 or your own 4th Code from Assignment 4 to include:

  1.image normalization:DONE
  
  2.L2 regularization:DONE
  
  3.ReLU after BN:DONE
  
2.Run your new code for 40 epochs and save the model with highest validation accuracy:DONE
3.Find out 25 misclassified images from the validation dataset and create an image gallery:DONE

Observation: The Max test accuracy instead of improving declined marginally from 99.47 to 97.99. To ascertain the reason behind this, the above changes were carried out individually in isolation and its effects on validation accuracy was monitored. It was found that the addition of L2 regularization had the greatest effect in bringing down the validation accuracy.
